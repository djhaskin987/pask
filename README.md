Pask
====

Pask PAckages files and tASKs in a tarball. Files are installed
relative to a project root in order of a given list, and tasks
bundled with them may be run after installation in order as well.

Pask is not yet considered stable; however, it is released and
presented here in the hopes that it will be useful. If you *do* find
a bug, please log an issue and I'll get to it presently.

## Installation, Quick Start, Tutorials, Reference?
